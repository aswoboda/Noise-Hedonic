It uses the hedonic regression technique on a Swedish data set that contains information about both road and railway noise for each property, and finds that road noise has a larger negative impact on the property prices than railway noise. This is in line with the evidence from the acoustical literature which has shown that individuals are more disturbed by road than railway noise, but contradicts recent results from a hedonic study on data of the United Kingdom.},

abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Awareness about worker safety in nighttime construction has been a major concern because it is believed that nighttime construction creates hazardous work conditions. However, only a few studies provide valuable comparative information about accident characteristics of nighttime and daytime highway construction activities. METHOD: This study investigates fatal accidents that occurred in Illinois highway work zones in the period 1996-2001 in order to determine the safety differences between nighttime and daytime highway construction. The lighting and weather conditions were included into the study as control parameters to see their effects on the frequency of fatal accidents occurring in work zones. RESULTS: According to this study, there is evidence that nighttime construction is more hazardous than daytime construction. The inclusion of a weather parameter into the analysis has limited effect on this finding. IMPACT ON INDUSTRY: The study justifies establishing an efficient work zone accident reporting system and taking all necessary measures to enhance safety in nighttime work zones.},

abstract = {This paper studies the effect of a newly completed highway extension on home prices in the surrounding area. We analyze non-linearities in both the effect of distance from the highway and the effect of time relative to the completion of the road segment. While previous studies of the effects of nearby amenities on property and land values have focused on either cross-sectional spatial or temporal patterns, the joint analysis of the two dimensions has not been thoroughly investigated. We use home sale data from a period of 11 years centered around the completion of a new highway extension in metropolitan Los Angeles. We combine a standard hedonic model with a spline regression technique to allow for non-linear variations of the effect along the temporal and spatial dimensions. Our empirical results show that the maximum home price appreciation caused by the new highway extension occurs at moderate distances from the highway after it is completed. Lower price increases for this period are observed for homes sold closer to the highway or much further away. This price pattern gradually fades away in the years following the construction completion. A similar, although weaker, price pattern is also observed in the first years of the construction period. There is no statistically significant distance dependency in the 2 years in our sample prior to the beginning of the construction. This indicates that the housing market is not fully efficient as the information about the impending construction of the highway is not immediately incorporated into sales prices.},

Proximity to open space is found to be a substitute for lot size, although the degree of substitutionalibility has eakened over time. Geographic variation in the marginal effects of lot size and proximity to open space is analyzed using LWR analysis.},
annote = {RQ: How does lot size and proximity to different kinds of open spaces (golf courses, parks, bodies of water, greenways) effect housing prices in Knox Cty, Tennessee, and does the effect vary both spatially and temporally?

        
Results: Moving 1,000 feet closer to open spaces from the mean distance results in almost universally higher housing prices, usually an increase of between \$165 and \$1,850, but the magnitude of the effect varies both geographically and temporally, depending on the quality of the open space and population density. The results are almost all statistically significant at the 5\% level. A 1000 sq ft increase in lot size from the mean also positively affects housing price by between \$100-\$750, depending on the time period and region. The effect of decreased density decreased over the 2 time periods.

        
Contribution: Cho, et al, uses LWR on data from a single TN county for both spatial and temporal hedonic housing price analysis. The variance in price effects of both lot size and open space proximity captured by the model will be helpful for land use planners, according to the authors. 

        
Data: Pertains to Knox County, TN. Utilized 4 primary GIS data sets: boundary data (Knoxville-Knox County Metropolitan Planning Commission), environmental feature data (Knoxville Utilities Board Geographic Informantion System (KGIS)), census-block group data (GeoLytics, a private data provider) , and individual residential data (KGIS and Knox County Tax Assessor's Office). 
Data is for single family homes sold between 1989-1991 and 1999-2001.

        
Methodology/Evidence: First determined via a likelihood ratio (LR) test that the data set should be seperated temporally and regressed seperately as supposed to being pooled. Compared the LWR model results to an OLS regression, found that LWR has higher adj. R-squared values, lower RSS, and F-values that confirm that the local models are a better fit than the global models for both time periods. Also tested for autocorrelation via I-values, and finds that the local model partially but not adequately addresses the AC found in the global models.

        
Future work: Since LWR failed to adequately address spatial autocorrelation in the data, incomplete/misspecification of the model cannot be ruled out, and so further research into spatial dynamics of the housing market is needed.

        
Questions/Comments: In your article, you mention that since LWR smooths parameter changes, it might be inaccurate when dealing with parameter jumps that could occur when moving beweteen neighborhoods. This could also be a concern here, and might have to do with the AC problem?

abstract = {Locally weighted regression, or loess, is a way of estimating a regression surface through a multivariate smoothing procedure, fitting a function of the independent variables locally and in a moving fashion analogous to how a moving average is computed for a time series. With local fitting we can estimate a much wider class of regression surfaces than with the usual classes of parametric functions, such as polynomials. The goal of this article is to show, through applications, how loess can be used for three purposes: data exploration, diagnostic checking of parametric models, and providing a nonparametric regression surface. Along the way, the following methodology is introduced: (a) a multivariate smoothing procedure that is an extension of univariate locally weighted regression; (b) statistical procedures that are analogous to those used in the least-squares fitting of parametric functions; (c) several graphical methods that are useful tools for understanding loess estimates and checking the assumptions on which the estimation procedure is based; and (d) the M plot, an adaptation of Mallows's Cp procedure, which provides a graphical portrayal of the trade-off between variance and bias, and which can be used to choose the amount of smoothing},

We compare various spatial econometric models and estimation methods in a hedonic price framework to examine the impact of noise on 2003 housing prices near the Atlanta airport. Spatial effects are best captured by a model including both spatial autocorrelation and autoregressive parameters estimated by a generalized moments approach. In our preferred model, houses located in an area in which noise disrupts normal activities (defined by a day–night sound level of 70–75 decibels) sell for 20.8 percent less than houses located where noise does not disrupt normal activities (defined by a day–night sound level below 65 decibels). The inclusion of spatial effects magnifies the negative price impacts of airport noise. Finally, after controlling for noise, houses farther from the airport sell for less; the price elasticity with respect to distance is −0.15, implying that airport proximity is an amenity.},

Separate hedonic price functions are estimated for each submarket and these functions are shown to differ significantly across submarkets. Further, the paper illustrates the use of a generalised moments estimator proposed by Kelejian and Prucha that accounts for spatial autocorrelation in property prices. Spatial autocorrelation is shown to be an important consideration with this data. The principal motivation of the research is to provide an indication of the impact of road traffic noise on the market price of property.

The influence of the level of road traffic noise exposure at the least exposed side on road traffic noise annoyance was studied in Amsterdam, The Netherlands. Road traffic noise exposure was assessed at the most and least exposed fa\c{c}ade (Lden,most and Lden,least respectively) of dwellings for subjects in a population based survey (N = 1,967). It was investigated if and to what extent relative quietness at the least exposed fa\c{c}ade affected the level of road traffic noise annoyance by comparing two groups: (1) The subgroup with a relatively quiet fa\c{c}ade; (2) the subgroup without a relatively quiet fa\c{c}ade (large versus small difference in exposure between most and least exposed fa\c{c}ade; DIF ≥ 10 dB and DIF < 10 dB respectively). In addition, it was investigated if and to what extent Lden,least affected the level of road traffic noise annoyance. Results indicate a significantly lower road traffic noise annoyance score at a given Lden,most, in the subgroup with DIF ≥ 10 dB versus DIF < 10 dB. Furthermore, results suggest an effect of Lden,least independent of Lden,most. The estimated size of the effect expressed in an equivalent change in Lden,most approximated 5 dB for both the difference between the two subgroups (DIF ≥ 10 dB and DIF < 10 dB), and for a 10 dB change in Lden,least.},

abstract = {With a detailed model of the cost of motor vehicle noise in the United States in 1990, we estimate that the external damage cost of this noise could range from as little as \$100 million per year to as much as \$40 billion per year, although we believe that the cost is not likely to exceed \$5 billion (1991\$). Our base-case estimate is \$3 billion. The wide range is due primarily to uncertainty regarding the cost of noise per decibel above a threshold, the interest rate, the amount of noise attenuation due to ground cover and intervening structures, the threshold level below which damages are assumed to be zero, the density of housing alongside roads, average traffic speeds, and the cost of noise away from the home.},

abstract = {Birmingham was the first city in the UK to produce citywide noise maps of the main transportation noise sources. This project was supported by the UK Government’s Department of Environment Transport and the Regions and was completed in 2000. The main achievement of this project was to demonstrate that was possible to carry out such an exercise in the UK by employing modern computer-based techniques to produce noise mapping data, subsequently produce data on noise exposure across the City and, thereby, examine the effects on noise exposure of potential noise reduction initiatives. In 2004, with the support and encouragement of central government, it was decided that the Birmingham Updated Noise Mapping Project (BUMP) would be undertaken. This project aims to extend the expertise that the City gained from the original noise mapping project to create a new and integrated environmental noise assessment methodology to aid in the future management of environmental noise in the City of Birmingham. In carrying out the updating project the City shall also attempt to satisfy the technical and reporting requirements of the so-called Environmental Noise Directive for the first round of strategic noise mapping. All EU member states are required to complete such mapping, for major roads, railways and airports and for all agglomerations with more than 250,000 inhabitants, by the middle of 2007. The intention is to complete and report on the BUMP project by April 2006. So the paper that will be presented will in effect be a progress report.},

The estimation results show that, while highway noise has a significant negative impact on forming reservation prices and predicting sale prices, the noise effect on duration of sales is not statistically significant. Empirical evidence also shows a negative impact of market duration on reservation prices, which indicates an updating process for reservation prices over time.},

More local influences, such as proximity to urban highway links, also may positively or negatively influence the desirability of a location. This study used a cross section of home sales in Hennepin County, Minnesota, from the years 2001 through 2004, along with a set of disaggregate regional accessibility measures, to estimate the value of access to employment and resident workers. The effects, whether as amenity or disamenity, were estimated for locations near major freeway links that had recently under- gone major construction to add capacity (or were scheduled to undergo such construction) at the time of the home sales. The richness of the home sales data set allowed for control of a number of structural attributes, as well as some site characteristics. Additional neighborhood characteristics (such as income levels and local educational quality) were added from supplemental data sources. Empirical results indicated that households highly valued access to employment. Access to other resident workers (i.e., competition for jobs) was considered a disamenity. Proximity to local highway access points associated positively with sale price, whereas proximity to the highway link itself associated negatively with that price. The study concluded with some implications for research and practice of the concept and measurement of the relationship between location and land value.},

These houses are located at least 200 m from the nearest arterial road; this distance was selected to filter out the effects of arterial road traffic. To minimize the risk of omitted variable bias and to deal with spatial autocorrelation, researchers estimated a fine-grained fixed effects model. A 1\% increase in total traffic would reduce by only \$24 the value of a \$420,000 house located within 100 m of a freeway. By contrast, a 1\% increase in truck traffic would decrease the value of a \$420,000 house located between 100 and 400 m from the nearest freeway by \$2,000 to \$2,750. These results are important for policy makers and for homeowners because of the expanding role of trucking in the economy.},

abstract = {We present a model of the distribution of noise annoyance with the mean varying as a function of the noise exposure. Day-night level (DNL) and day-evening-night level (DENL) were used as noise descriptors. Because the entire annoyance distribution has been modeled, any annoyance measure that summarizes this distribution can be calculated from the model. We fitted the model to data from noise annoyance studies for aircraft, road traffic, and railways separately. Polynomial approxi- mations of relationships implied by the model for the combinations of the following exposure and annoyance measures are presented: DNL or DENL, and percentage "highly annoyed" (cutoff at 72 on a scale of 0-100), percentage "annoyed" (cutoff at 50 on a scale of 0-100), or percentage (at least) "a little annoyed" (cutoff at 28 on a scale of 0-100). These approximations are very good, and they are easier to use for practical calculations than the model itself, because the model involves a nor? mal distribution. Our results are based on the same data set that was used earlier to establish relation? ships between DNL and percentage highly annoyed. In this paper we provide better estimates of the confidence intervals due to the improved model of the relationship between annoyance and noise exposure. Moreover, relationships using descriptors other than DNL and percentage highly annoyed, which are presented here, have not been established earlier on the basis of a large dataset.

Although several limited studies of highway noise and house prices appeared before Gamble et al. (1974), this was the first major study that applied HP methods to road traffic noise. They studied US interstate highways in four communities in New Jersey, Virginia, and Maryland. Other early work includes HP studies of traffic noise for Washington, DC (Nelson 1975, 1978), Chicago (Vaughan and Huckins 1975), and Toronto (Taylor et al. 1980), and a repeat-sales analysis for Spokane, Washington, by Palmquist (1982). The repeat-sales model is derived from the HP model by observing the sale of the same house at two or more points in time.

abstract = {Because of large planned infrastructual projects like expansion of the main airport and construction of high-speed railways, noise nuisance has become a national social topic in the Netherlands. Moreover, according to EU-guidelines, determination and enforcement of differentiated noise limits will be delegated from national to local governments in the near future. The value of noise has never been this important. In this paper, we estimate the non-linear impact of traffic noise on property prices. The used data set is very extensive, over 100,000 sales transactions are studied, with many individual property characteristics, combined with noise levels for 2 million small 100 by 100m areas. We use spatial autocorrelation techniques to overcome regular problems of tranditional NIMBY-analysis performed by hedonic regression. In a rising market, we find that the impact of traffic noise ranges to 12 percent, with an average of about 5 percetn. The discount varies across sub-markets, and is a non-linear function of the noise level.},

abstract = {Studies have shown that some of the most pervasive sources of noise in our environment today are those associated with transportation. Traffic noise tends to be a dominant noise source in our urban as well as rural environment. In response to the problems associated with traffic noise, the United States Code of Federal Regulations Part 772 (23 CFR 772), "Procedures for Abatement of Highway Traffic Noise and Construction Noise," establishes standards for mitigating highway traffic noise. The purpose of this document is to provide Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) policies and guidance for the analysis and abatement of highway traffic noise. A 3½-day training course, sponsored by the National Highway Institute, is available for instructing FHWA field and State highway agency (SHA) staffs in the details of the policies and the technical procedures required for analyzing and abating traffic noise impacts.},

The residual costs are assessed from a survey, including an ordinal life satisfaction scale, on which individual respondents have scored. The derived compensation scheme depends on, among other things, the objective noise level, income, the degree to which prices account for noise differences, and the presence of noise insulation.},

We find perceived noise pollution to exert a negative and highly significant effect on happiness. We then calculate the required income transfer to compensate for the noise and find the costs of noise pollution to be on the order of €172 per month per household.},

@article{Wilhelmsson2000,
abstract = {The objective of this paper is to provide an empirical analysis of the impact traffic noise has on the values of single-family houses. Under the assumption that negative externalities are capitalized into house values, the hedonic price method is used. Issues of asymmetric information and disequilibrium are discussed and tested. Furthermore, the cost-benefit valuation has been corrected for the existence of property tax. Noise pollution was found to have a substantial negative effect on housing values. A single-family house of SEK975 000 would sell for SEK650 000 if located near a road where noise is loud, equivalent to a total discount of 30\%.},

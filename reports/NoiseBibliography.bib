It uses the hedonic regression technique on a Swedish data set that contains information about both road and railway noise for each property, and finds that road noise has a larger negative impact on the property prices than railway noise. This is in line with the evidence from the acoustical literature which has shown that individuals are more disturbed by road than railway noise, but contradicts recent results from a hedonic study on data of the United Kingdom.},

abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Awareness about worker safety in nighttime construction has been a major concern because it is believed that nighttime construction creates hazardous work conditions. However, only a few studies provide valuable comparative information about accident characteristics of nighttime and daytime highway construction activities. METHOD: This study investigates fatal accidents that occurred in Illinois highway work zones in the period 1996-2001 in order to determine the safety differences between nighttime and daytime highway construction. The lighting and weather conditions were included into the study as control parameters to see their effects on the frequency of fatal accidents occurring in work zones. RESULTS: According to this study, there is evidence that nighttime construction is more hazardous than daytime construction. The inclusion of a weather parameter into the analysis has limited effect on this finding. IMPACT ON INDUSTRY: The study justifies establishing an efficient work zone accident reporting system and taking all necessary measures to enhance safety in nighttime work zones.},

A general decline in noise boosted housing prices during 1995–2002. After accounting for proximity, house characteristics, and demographic variables, houses in noisier areas sold for less than houses subjected to less noise. Also, the noise discount is larger during 2000–2002 than 1995–1999},

The major innovation of the research is the use of hierarchical clustering techniques to identify property submarkets defined by a combination of property types, locations and socioeconomic characteristics of inhabitants. Separate hedonic price functions are estimated for each submarket and these functions are shown to differ significantly across submarkets. Further, the paper illustrates the use of a generalised moments estimator proposed by Kelejian and Prucha that accounts for spatial autocorrelation in property prices. Spatial autocorrelation is shown to be an important consideration with this data. The principal motivation of the research is to provide an indication of the impact of road traffic noise on the market price of property. In all but one of the submarkets exposure to road traffic noise is shown to have a significant negative impact on property prices.},

The value of noise has never been this important. In this paper, we estimate the non-linear impact of traffic noise on property prices. The used data set is very extensive, over 100,000 sales transactions are studied, with many individual property characteristics, combined with noise levels for 2 million small 100 by 100m areas. We use spatial autocorrelation techniques to overcome regular problems of tranditional NIMBY-analysis performed by hedonic regression. In a rising market, we find that the impact of traffic noise ranges to 12 percent, with an average of about 5 percetn. The discount varies across sub-markets, and is a non-linear function of the noise level.},

abstract = {The objective of this paper is to provide an empirical analysis of the impact traffic noise has on the values of single-family houses. Under the assumption that negative externalities are capitalized into house values, the hedonic price method is used. Issues of asymmetric information and disequilibrium are discussed and tested. Furthermore, the cost-benefit valuation has been corrected for the existence of property tax. Noise pollution was found to have a substantial negative effect on housing values. A single-family house of SEK975 000 would sell for SEK650 000 if located near a road where noise is loud, equivalent to a total discount of 30\%.},

\contentsline {figure}{\numberline {2}{\ignorespaces This figure shows the relationship between bandwidth size and the GCV score for three different Locally Weighted Regression (LWR) models. For comparison, the GCV scores for each model when estimated at a global scale are also shown. Note that the LWR models all have significantly smaller GCV scores than the global models. The minimum GCV score is obtained by LWR Model (3) at a bandwidth of 200 nearest houses.\relax }}{36}{figure.caption.4}

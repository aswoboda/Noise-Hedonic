We ran LWR for different bandwidths and the GCV score suggests we use a bandwidth of around 100 nearest neighbors. Do the coefficients for certain variables actually vary over space? Or do we get prety similar coefficients using LWR and the global model?
* A Monte Carlo test of significance for spatial non-stationarity in the coefficients is described in the GWR book by Fotheringham, et al. (2002) on page 213.
Calculate the variance of the vector of coefficients across your observations for your preferred LWR model. 
Now reshuffle the location of your data.
Rerun LWR and see which bandwidth minimizes the GCV score.
Keep track of the:
*** variance of the coefficients,
*** minimum GCV score
*** optimal bandwidth
Do these steps numerous times and then plot the distribution of the statistics we kept track of throughout the simulation. Where do our actual LWR values fall in the distribution?

Save the data after each round of the simulation so we can look at pre-liminary results. 


After the meeting with Daniel Alabi... we might want to move the data to the shared folder and not replicate it across user accounts on Rserver.its.carleton.edu

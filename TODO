  Calculate Marginal Effects for preliminary LWR models and current best global model (with all theinteraction terms) (land and MAX)
  Map above
  Calculate residuals from LWR models
  Moran's I for residuals from LWR and global models


Talk with Max about the data work he did. 
  What data do we have? Everything and more.
  How did we get to it?
  What were the next steps planned?

Start building up a database of articles on hedonic analysis and traffic noise (in Mendeley)
  Particular to Minneapolis/St. Paul?
  How are people estimating traffic noise?
  What traffic variable are people including in the model? (max? mean? night/day?)
  How are people modeling the house prices?
    unit of analysis (individual houses sales? EMV? Mean EMV by census tract?)

  how do I cache large calculations so that computer doesn't have to do them each time?

For Aaron
  run LWR on Dakota County to see if the additional structural characteristics seem to matter

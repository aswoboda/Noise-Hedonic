abstract = {Previous studies indicate that residents may benefit from a "quiet side" to their dwellings. The influence of the level of road traffic noise exposure at the least exposed side on road traffic noise annoyance was studied in Amsterdam, The Netherlands. Road traffic noise exposure was assessed at the most and least exposed fa\c{c}ade (Lden,most and Lden,least respectively) of dwellings for subjects in a population based survey (N = 1,967). It was investigated if and to what extent relative quietness at the least exposed fa\c{c}ade affected the level of road traffic noise annoyance by comparing two groups: (1) The subgroup with a relatively quiet fa\c{c}ade; (2) the subgroup without a relatively quiet fa\c{c}ade (large versus small difference in exposure between most and least exposed fa\c{c}ade; DIF ≥ 10 dB and DIF < 10 dB respectively). In addition, it was investigated if and to what extent Lden,least affected the level of road traffic noise annoyance. Results indicate a significantly lower road traffic noise annoyance score at a given Lden,most, in the subgroup with DIF ≥ 10 dB versus DIF < 10 dB. Furthermore, results suggest an effect of Lden,least independent of Lden,most. The estimated size of the effect expressed in an equivalent change in Lden,most approximated 5 dB for both the difference between the two subgroups (DIF ≥ 10 dB and DIF < 10 dB), and for a 10 dB change in Lden,least.},

abstract = {People typically choose to live in quiet areas in order to safeguard their health and wellbeing. However, the benefits of living in quiet areas are relatively understudied compared to the burdens associated with living in noisy areas. Additionally, research is increasingly focusing on the relationship between the human response to noise and measures of health and wellbeing, complementing traditional dose-response approaches, and further elucidating the impact of noise and health by incorporating human factors as mediators and moderators. To further explore the benefits of living in quiet areas, we compared the results of health-related quality of life (HRQOL) questionnaire datasets collected from households in localities differentiated by their soundscapes and population density: noisy city, quiet city, quiet rural, and noisy rural. The dose-response relationships between noise annoyance and HRQOL measures indicated an inverse relationship between the two. Additionally, quiet areas were found to have higher mean HRQOL domain scores than noisy areas. This research further supports the protection of quiet locales and ongoing noise abatement in noisy areas.},

These houses are located at least 200 m from the nearest arterial road; this distance was selected to filter out the effects of arterial road traffic. To minimize the risk of omitted variable bias and to deal with spatial autocorrelation, researchers estimated a fine-grained fixed effects model. A 1\% increase in total traffic would reduce by only \$24 the value of a \$420,000 house located within 100 m of a freeway. By contrast, a 1\% increase in truck traffic would decrease the value of a \$420,000 house located between 100 and 400 m from the nearest freeway by \$2,000 to \$2,750. These results are important for policy makers and for homeowners because of the expanding role of trucking in the economy.},

abstract = {We analyze 20,660 transactions of single family detached houses sold in 2003 and 2004 in the city of Los Angeles, CA, to estimate the value of urban trees, irrigated grass, and non-irrigated grass areas. To deal with spatial autocorrelation and unobserved neighborhood characteristics, we contrast two models: a geographically weighted regression model, and a CliffOrd model with spatial lags in the dependent variable, the exogenous variables, and the disturbances as well as submarket fixed effects and an extensive set of covariates. We find that Angelenos like lawns: over 88\% of the properties examined would gain value with additional irrigated grass on their parcel, and even more (89\%) in their neighborhood. Although more non-irrigated grass/bare soil on parcels typically hurts property values, it often has the opposite effect at the neighborhood level. Moreover, additional parcel trees would decrease the value of almost 40\% of the properties examined and they would have only a small positive impact on most of the others. By contrast, additional neighborhood trees would slightly increase the value of over 97\% of the properties analyzed. This suggests that while Los Angeles residents may want additional trees, they are unwilling to pay for them. These results have implications for urban tree planting programs that rely primarily on private property owners.},

question is: how exactly are residents benefiting from the spillover effect?

If instead the answer is that residents derive pleasure from their neighbors’ higher property values, perhaps because those neighbors use some of their capital gains to beautify their houses in ways unobservable to the outside analyst, then the spillover effect represents a technological externality because it directly increases each resident’s utility.},

Extending the Capozza and Helsey model (1989) to the case of uncertainty in future land use zoning, a spatialized hedonic model is proposed to estimate such anticipation phenomena at a fine level (cadastral unit). Estimations use Mixed Geographically Weighted Regression (MGWR) techniques with a two-stage model that links agricultural and developable land markets. This allows for mapping varying spatial parameters that measure anticipation effects within the theoretical framework. Results confirm the influence of anticipation on agricultural land prices in the Provence region. Moreover, the level of data spatialization allows us to take into account intra-municipalities' heterogeneity of land use conversion anticipation.},

The effects, whether as amenity or disamenity, were estimated for locations near major freeway links that had recently under- gone major construction to add capacity (or were scheduled to undergo such construction) at the time of the home sales. The richness of the home sales data set allowed for control of a number of structural attributes, as well as some site characteristics. Additional neighborhood characteristics (such as income levels and local educational quality) were added from supplemental data sources. Empirical results indicated that households highly valued access to employment. Access to other resident workers (i.e., competition for jobs) was considered a disamenity. Proximity to local highway access points associated positively with sale price, whereas proximity to the highway link itself associated negatively with that price.

abstract = {Large variability and correlations among the coefficients obtained from the method of geographically weighted regression (GWR) have been identified in previous research. This is an issue that poses a serious challenge for the utility of the method as a tool to investigate multivariate relationships. The objectives of this paper are to assess: (1) the ability of GWR to discriminate between a spatially constant processes and one with spatially varying relationships; and (2) to accurately retrieve spatially varying relationships. Extensive numerical experiments are used to investigate situations where the underlying process is stationary and nonstationary, and to assess the degree to which spurious intercoefficient correlations are introduced. Two different implementations of GWR and cross-validation approaches are assessed. Results suggest that judicious application of GWR can be used to discern whether the underlying process is nonstationary. Furthermore, evidence of spurious correlations indicates that caution must be exercised when drawing conclusions regarding spatial relationships retrieved using this approach, particularly when working with small samples.},
annote = {RQ: How well does LWR discriminate between a spatially constant processes and one with spatially varying relationships and how accurately does LWR estimate spatially varying relationships?
        
Results: Depending on the level of true correlation in variables, estimation (either LWR or Local Linear) and CV approaches (standardized or not), LWR will falsely prescribe non-stationary processes 10\%-50\% of the time. The authors confirm that a "nonnegligible" amount of spatial variation and subsequently correlation between LWR coeff. surfaces is inherently generated by the method. Tendency to overfit. 
        
Contributions: This article contributes to the literature by examining these two issues(stationary/non-stationary discrimination and retrieving reliable parametric surfaces) by considering different estimation/CV techniques not considered previously. 
                  
Future work: Systematically changing sample sizes, determining a minimum sample size for LWR, introducing varying levels of correlation between coefficient surfaces, as supposed to one fixed rate.

It uses the hedonic regression technique on a Swedish data set that contains information about both road and railway noise for each property, and finds that road noise has a larger negative impact on the property prices than railway noise. This is in line with the evidence from the acoustical literature which has shown that individuals are more disturbed by road than railway noise, but contradicts recent results from a hedonic study on data of the United Kingdom.},

@article{McMillen2010,
abstract = {In contrast to the rigid structure of standard parametric hedonic analysis, nonparametric estimators control for misspecified spatial effects while using highly flexible functional forms. Despite these advantages, nonparametric procedures are still not used extensively for spatial data analysis due to perceived difficulties associated with estimation and hypothesis testing. We demonstrate that nonparametric estimation is feasible for large datasets with many independent variables, offering statistical tests of individual covariates and tests of model specification. We show that fixed parameterization of distance to the nearest rapid transit line is a misspecification and that pricing of access to this amenity varies across neighborhoods within Chicago.},
annote = {RQ: Is the use of LWR in an hedonic analysis of spatial data feasible, and does it accurately describe hedonic house price function compared to fixed parametric spatial models in the context of Monte Carlo procedure and Chicago housing price hedonic analysis?
        
Results: The Monte Carlo procedure shows that LWR conserves on DoF and achieves a high level of predictive accuracy compared to fully nonparametric estimation. The hedonic analysis yields geographically varying estimates of the price of EL access, suggesting that fixed parameter estimates are less accurate/misspecified
        
Contribution: Redfearn and McMillen demonstrate the usefulness of LWR through a Monte Carlo procedure, and show that fixed parameter hedonic estimates of EL accessability mask geographical variance, which a LWR picks up on. 
        
Data: Generated data sets in order to perform Monte Carlo procedure, one with a continuously declining dependent variable with distance from the city center and one with irregular "neighborhoods" that introduce shifts in the values.
For the hedonic estimate, a data set of 3,705 observations of Chicago single-family home sales in 2000 within 1 mile of Chicago's elevated train (EL) was used. Assessor's data was used to obtain standard housing characteristics like lot size, \# of rooms, etc. 
        
Methodology: The Monte Carlo procedure was performed with a smoothly changing spatial dependent variable and one with shifts, representing neighborhoods. A third procedure was performed with proxied fixed effects and slope interactions, to introduce some error/uncertainty and more accurately reflect the real world, where researchers will not have perfect knowledge of neighborhood boundaries. 
In the hedonic estimate of the component of EL proximity as in single-family housing prices, the authors first performed a global OWL linear regression that, in its final form, resulted in statistically insignificant results for distance from El stop, thanks to the geographic noise from the data. LWR was then used, both with a 25\% window size and a 100\% window size, with both nonparametric and semi-parametric estimates. 
        
Evidence: The authors state that a large window needs to be used for locational variables, like distance to nearest EL stop, in order to measure the marginal effects, and with a window size of 100\%, find that prices decline by almost 17\% per additional mile from the nearest EL stop. For a 25\% window, the spatial pattern of the coefficients shows information that a simple OLS would simply mask because of data aggregation. The authors provide additional evidence for the strength of LWR by withholding 400 random observations from their data set and using the rest of data set to "predict" the holdouts. RSME for the LWR was much lower than the OLS, and while OLS with census tract fixed effects had a slightly lower RSME than LWR, LWR used only 1/3 the degrees of freedom. 
        
Future Work: While the authors seek to introduce LWR as a new and powerful tool, it is not the single "best" approach, and thus there might be other ways that provide accurate alternatives that should be examined.

This modeling strategy better represents micro-market realities and the importance of location as a prime determinant of housing prices. our results, based on a unique dataset of almost 14,000 single-family home sales between 1993 and 2001 in Southern California suggest regulation had strong direct impacts on the housing market as suggested by Glaeser and Gyourko (2003) and Cheung et al.

Result/Answer: Housing regulation has a strong positive effect on Soutern California housing prices. The GCV score is much smaller, suggesting that previous estimates made inappropriate assumptions in aggregating the data.

        
Contribution to field: Compared to previous estimates, LWR relaxes restrictive assumptions that have led to biased estimates of the regulatory "shadow cost" in the past. LWR estimates have a much tighter regression spread, suggesting that, in this case, LWR is more descriptive of SoCal real estate conditions.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVES: To assess the association between hypertension and traffic noise. METHODS: The prevalence and incidence of hypertension were examined in a Swedish municipality partly affected by noise from a highway (20,000 vehicles/24 h) and a railway (200 trains/24 h). A-weighed 24 h average sound levels (L(Aeq,24h)) from road and railway traffic were calculated at each residential building using a geographical information system and a validated model. Physician-diagnosed hypertension, antihypertensive medication and background factors were evaluated in 1953 individuals using postal questionnaires (71\% response rate). Prevalence ratios and odds ratios (ORs) were calculated for different noise categories. Based on year of moving into the residence and year of diagnosis, person-years and incidence rates of hypertension were estimated, as well as relative risks including covariates, using Poisson and Cox regression. RESULTS: When road traffic noise, age, sex, heredity and body mass index were included in logistic regression models, and allowing for >10 years of latency, the OR for hypertension was 1.9 (95\% CI 1.1 to 3.5) in the highest noise category (56-70 dBA) and 3.8 (95\% CI 1.6 to 9.0) in men. The incidence rate ratio was increased in this group of men, and the relative risk of hypertension in a Poisson regression model was 2.9 (95\% CI 1.4 to 6.2). There were no clear associations in women or for railway noise. CONCLUSIONS: The study shows a positive association between residential road traffic noise and hypertension among men, and an exposure-response relationship. While prevalence ratios were increased, findings were more pronounced when incidence was assessed.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Results from studies of road traffic noise and hypertension are heterogeneous with respect to effect size, effects among males and females and with respect to effects across age groups. Our objective was to further explore these associations. METHODS: The study used cross-sectional public health survey data from southern Sweden, including 24,238 adults (18 - 80 years old). We used a geographic information system (GIS) to assess the average road noise (LAeq 24 hr) at the current residential address. Effects on self-reported hypertension were estimated by logistic regression with adjustment for age, sex, BMI, alcohol intake, exercise, education, smoking and socioeconomic status. RESULTS: Modest exposure effects (OR approximately 1.1) were generally noted in intermediate exposure categories (45 -64 dB(A)), and with no obvious trend. The effect was more pronounced at > 64 dB(A) (OR 1.45, 95\% CI 1.04 - 2.02). Age modified the relative effect (p = 0.018). An effect was seen among middle-aged (40 - 59 years old) at noise levels 60 - 64 dB(A) (OR = 1.27, 95\% CI 1.02 - 1.58)) and at > 64 dB(A) (OR = 1.91, 95\% CI 1.19 - 3.06)). An effect was also indicated among younger adults but not among elderly. No apparent effect modification by gender, country of origin, disturbed sleep or strained economy was noted. CONCLUSION: The study supports an association between road traffic noise at high average levels and self-reported hypertension in middle-aged. Future studies should use age group -specific relative effect models to account for differences in prevalence.},

abstract = {This paper studies the effect of a newly completed highway extension on home prices in the surrounding area. We analyze non-linearities in both the effect of distance from the highway and the effect of time relative to the completion of the road segment. While previous studies of the effects of nearby amenities on property and land values have focused on either cross-sectional spatial or temporal patterns, the joint analysis of the two dimensions has not been thoroughly investigated. We use home sale data from a period of 11 years centered around the completion of a new highway extension in metropolitan Los Angeles. We combine a standard hedonic model with a spline regression technique to allow for non-linear variations of the effect along the temporal and spatial dimensions. Our empirical results show that the maximum home price appreciation caused by the new highway extension occurs at moderate distances from the highway after it is completed. Lower price increases for this period are observed for homes sold closer to the highway or much further away. This price pattern gradually fades away in the years following the construction completion. A similar, although weaker, price pattern is also observed in the first years of the construction period. There is no statistically significant distance dependency in the 2 years in our sample prior to the beginning of the construction. This indicates that the housing market is not fully efficient as the information about the impending construction of the highway is not immediately incorporated into sales prices.},

The findings show that the value of proximity to greenways, parks, and water bodies increased over time, while the value of lot size and proximity to golf cources fell. Proximity to open space is found to be a substitute for lot size, although the degree of substitutionalibility has eakened over time. Geographic variation in the marginal effects of lot size and proximity to open space is analyzed using LWR analysis.},
annote = {RQ: How does lot size and proximity to different kinds of open spaces (golf courses, parks, bodies of water, greenways) effect housing prices in Knox Cty, Tennessee, and does the effect vary both spatially and temporally?

        
Results: Moving 1,000 feet closer to open spaces from the mean distance results in almost universally higher housing prices, usually an increase of between \$165 and \$1,850, but the magnitude of the effect varies both geographically and temporally, depending on the quality of the open space and population density. The results are almost all statistically significant at the 5\% level. A 1000 sq ft increase in lot size from the mean also positively affects housing price by between \$100-\$750, depending on the time period and region. The effect of decreased density decreased over the 2 time periods.

        
Contribution: Cho, et al, uses LWR on data from a single TN county for both spatial and temporal hedonic housing price analysis. The variance in price effects of both lot size and open space proximity captured by the model will be helpful for land use planners, according to the authors. 

        
Data: Pertains to Knox County, TN. Utilized 4 primary GIS data sets: boundary data (Knoxville-Knox County Metropolitan Planning Commission), environmental feature data (Knoxville Utilities Board Geographic Informantion System (KGIS)), census-block group data (GeoLytics, a private data provider) , and individual residential data (KGIS and Knox County Tax Assessor's Office). 
Data is for single family homes sold between 1989-1991 and 1999-2001.

        
Methodology/Evidence: First determined via a likelihood ratio (LR) test that the data set should be seperated temporally and regressed seperately as supposed to being pooled. Compared the LWR model results to an OLS regression, found that LWR has higher adj. R-squared values, lower RSS, and F-values that confirm that the local models are a better fit than the global models for both time periods. Also tested for autocorrelation via I-values, and finds that the local model partially but not adequately addresses the AC found in the global models.

        
Future work: Since LWR failed to adequately address spatial autocorrelation in the data, incomplete/misspecification of the model cannot be ruled out, and so further research into spatial dynamics of the housing market is needed.

        
Questions/Comments: In your article, you mention that since LWR smooths parameter changes, it might be inaccurate when dealing with parameter jumps that could occur when moving beweteen neighborhoods. This could also be a concern here, and might have to do with the AC problem?

abstract = {Noise is one of the major pollutants of highway traffic, and it is much more noticeable to local residents than any other traffic pollution. The main purpose of this research is to examine the impact of highway traffic noise on residential property values. Hedonic methods were employed to decompose property value to its characteristics. Linear regression models were constructed to estimate the Noise Depreciation Sensitive Index (NSDI) and verify the relationship between a noise wall and property value. This coefficient indicates a NSDI of 0.34, which means a unit increase in the traffic noise level (dBA in Leq) will cause a depreciation of a property of 0.34\% of its sale price.},

We compare various spatial econometric models and estimation methods in a hedonic price framework to examine the impact of noise on 2003 housing prices near the Atlanta airport. Spatial effects are best captured by a model including both spatial autocorrelation and autoregressive parameters estimated by a generalized moments approach. In our preferred model, houses located in an area in which noise disrupts normal activities (defined by a day–night sound level of 70–75 decibels) sell for 20.8 percent less than houses located where noise does not disrupt normal activities (defined by a day–night sound level below 65 decibels). The inclusion of spatial effects magnifies the negative price impacts of airport noise. Finally, after controlling for noise, houses farther from the airport sell for less; the price elasticity with respect to distance is −0.15, implying that airport proximity is an amenity.},

Although several limited studies of highway noise and house prices appeared before Gamble et al. (1974), this was the first major study that applied HP methods to road traffic noise. They studied US interstate highways in four communities in New Jersey, Virginia, and Maryland. Other early work includes HP studies of traffic noise for Washington, DC (Nelson 1975, 1978), Chicago (Vaughan and Huckins 1975), and Toronto (Taylor et al. 1980), and a repeat-sales analysis for Spokane, Washington, by Palmquist (1982). The repeat-sales model is derived from the HP model by observing the sale of the same house at two or more points in time.

Early HP studies often used small samples that covered limited geographic areas, such as residential areas in close proximity to a major airport or busy highway.},

However, only a few studies provide valuable comparative information about accident characteristics of nighttime and daytime highway construction activities. METHOD: This study investigates fatal accidents that occurred in Illinois highway work zones in the period 1996-2001 in order to determine the safety differences between nighttime and daytime highway construction. The lighting and weather conditions were included into the study as control parameters to see their effects on the frequency of fatal accidents occurring in work zones. RESULTS: According to this study, there is evidence that nighttime construction is more hazardous than daytime construction. The inclusion of a weather parameter into the analysis has limited effect on this finding. IMPACT ON INDUSTRY: The study justifies establishing an efficient work zone accident reporting system and taking all necessary measures to enhance safety in nighttime work zones.},

The literature remains divided on the issue of whether the vehicle ownership rates will ever catch up to the levels common in the advanced economies. This paper contributes to the debate by building a model that explicitly models the vehicle saturation level as a function of observable country characteristics: urbanization and population density. Our model is estimated on the basis of pooled time-series (1960-2002) and cross- section data for 45 countries that include 75 percent of the world's population. We project that the total vehicle stock will increase from about 800 million in 2002 to more than two billion units in 2030. By this time, 56\% of the world's vehicles will be owned by non-OECD countries , compared with 24\% in 2002. In particular ; China's vehicle stock will increase nearly twenty-fold, to 390 million in 2030. This fast speed of vehicle ownership expansion implies rapid growth in oil demand.},

abstract = {Noise is defined as unwanted sound. Environmental noise consists of all the unwanted sounds in our communities except that which originates in the workplace. Environmental noise pollution, a form of air pollution, is a threat to health and well-being. It is more severe and widespread than ever before, and it will continue to increase in magnitude and severity because of population growth, urbanization, and the associated growth in the use of increasingly powerful, varied, and highly mobile sources of noise. It will also continue to grow because of sustained growth in highway, rail, and air traffic, which remain major sources of environmental noise. The potential health effects of noise pollution are numerous, pervasive, persistent, and medically and socially significant. Noise produces direct and cumulative adverse effects that impair health and that degrade residential, social, working, and learning environments with corresponding real (economic) and intangible (well-being) losses. It interferes with sleep, concentration, communication, and recreation. The aim of enlightened governmental controls should be to protect citizens from the adverse effects of airborne pollution, including those produced by noise. People have the right to choose the nature of their acoustical environment; it should not be imposed by others. (C) 2007 Southern Medical Association},

A socio-acoustic survey among 1953 persons aged 18-75 years was conducted in residential areas exposed to railway and road traffic noise with sound levels ranging from L(Aeq,24h) 45-72 dB in a municipality east of Gothenburg, Sweden. The objectives were to assess various adverse health effects, including annoyance, and to elucidate the impact of exposure to single and combined noise sources. In areas exposed to both railway and road traffic, the proportion annoyed by the total traffic sound environment (total annoyance) was significantly higher than in areas with one dominant noise source (rail or road traffic) with the same total sound exposure (L(Aeq,24h,tot)). This interaction effect was significant from 59 dB and increased gradually with higher sound levels. Effects of the total sound exposure should be considered in risk assessments and in noise mitigation activities.},

abstract = {Birmingham was the first city in the UK to produce citywide noise maps of the main transportation noise sources. This project was supported by the UK Government’s Department of Environment Transport and the Regions and was completed in 2000. The main achievement of this project was to demonstrate that was possible to carry out such an exercise in the UK by employing modern computer-based techniques to produce noise mapping data, subsequently produce data on noise exposure across the City and, thereby, examine the effects on noise exposure of potential noise reduction initiatives. In 2004, with the support and encouragement of central government, it was decided that the Birmingham Updated Noise Mapping Project (BUMP) would be undertaken. This project aims to extend the expertise that the City gained from the original noise mapping project to create a new and integrated environmental noise assessment methodology to aid in the future management of environmental noise in the City of Birmingham. In carrying out the updating project the City shall also attempt to satisfy the technical and reporting requirements of the so-called Environmental Noise Directive for the first round of strategic noise mapping. All EU member states are required to complete such mapping, for major roads, railways and airports and for all agglomerations with more than 250,000 inhabitants, by the middle of 2007. The intention is to complete and report on the BUMP project by April 2006. So the paper that will be presented will in effect be a progress report.},

abstract = {Because of large planned infrastructual projects like expansion of the main airport and construction of high-speed railways, noise nuisance has become a national social topic in the Netherlands. Moreover, according to EU-guidelines, determination and enforcement of differentiated noise limits will be delegated from national to local governments in the near future. The value of noise has never been this important. In this paper, we estimate the non-linear impact of traffic noise on property prices. The used data set is very extensive, over 100,000 sales transactions are studied, with many individual property characteristics, combined with noise levels for 2 million small 100 by 100m areas. We use spatial autocorrelation techniques to overcome regular problems of tranditional NIMBY-analysis performed by hedonic regression. In a rising market, we find that the impact of traffic noise ranges to 12 percent, with an average of about 5 percetn. The discount varies across sub-markets, and is a non-linear function of the noise level.},

The major innovation of the research is the use of hierarchical clustering techniques to identify property submarkets defined by a combination of property types, locations and socioeconomic characteristics of inhabitants. Separate hedonic price functions are estimated for each submarket and these functions are shown to differ significantly across submarkets. Further, the paper illustrates the use of a generalised moments estimator proposed by Kelejian and Prucha that accounts for spatial autocorrelation in property prices. Spatial autocorrelation is shown to be an important consideration with this data. The principal motivation of the research is to provide an indication of the impact of road traffic noise on the market price of property. In all but one of the submarkets exposure to road traffic noise is shown to have a significant negative impact on property prices.},

abstract = {We present a model of the distribution of noise annoyance with the mean varying as a function of the noise exposure. Day-night level (DNL) and day-evening-night level (DENL) were used as noise descriptors. Because the entire annoyance distribution has been modeled, any annoyance measure that summarizes this distribution can be calculated from the model. We fitted the model to data from noise annoyance studies for aircraft, road traffic, and railways separately. Polynomial approxi- mations of relationships implied by the model for the combinations of the following exposure and annoyance measures are presented: DNL or DENL, and percentage "highly annoyed" (cutoff at 72 on a scale of 0-100), percentage "annoyed" (cutoff at 50 on a scale of 0-100), or percentage (at least) "a little annoyed" (cutoff at 28 on a scale of 0-100). These approximations are very good, and they are easier to use for practical calculations than the model itself, because the model involves a nor? mal distribution. Our results are based on the same data set that was used earlier to establish relation? ships between DNL and percentage highly annoyed. In this paper we provide better estimates of the confidence intervals due to the improved model of the relationship between annoyance and noise exposure. Moreover, relationships using descriptors other than DNL and percentage highly annoyed, which are presented here, have not been established earlier on the basis of a large dataset.

abstract = {In this paper the negative effects resulting from exposure to road traffic noise on people's well being is reviewed in the light of the latest published findings. Annoyance is particularly focused on, which is considered to be one of the first and most widespread reactions to environmental noise. The nonauditory effects of noise on humans are viewed as being generally stress-related, following observations that noise exposures engender physiological reactions typical to those of stress. First, a short presentation is made of what noise in general is. Subsequently, in order to assess some subjective judgements of noise, some of the important noise descriptors, which are often used to quantify various aspects of road traffic noise are introduced. In general terms, it is found from the present review that the continuous exposure of people to road traffic noise leads to suffering from various kinds of discomfort, thus reducing appreciably the number of their well-being elements. Drawing such a conclusion is hindered by difficulties when nonacoustical factors, for instance socio-economic situation, age and gender, are also taken into account along with the usual acoustical factors of road traffic noise. One of people's first and direct reactions to noise is in terms of annoyance. The results of several decades of research on this topic have permitted lately the establishment of a more or less quantitative relationship between the objective quantities characterizing road traffic noise and the human subjective reaction to it as expressed by annoyance. These findings are important at both the society and the individual level, in as much as they may help in regulating in a more efficient way the planning of road traffic activity in order to secure at least the minimum of comfort to the affected population. 2001 Academic Press.},

abstract = {Air pollution from traffic is one of the main factors considered in the environmental appraisal of road schemes. Currently this appraisal concentrates on the emission and roadside concentration of those regulated pollutants which are potentially harmful to the health or well-being of human, animal or plant life, or to ecological systems. However, vehicle emissions, especially those from diesel vehicles, may also cause a number of aesthetic and nuisance problems, such a visibility reduction, urban soiling and physical irritation. A methodology to investigated the subjective nuisance effects of air pollution from road traffic on the public has been developed and tested. The data indicates that vehicle-derived air pollution was an issue of high relative importance to the public when compared to other major social issues. On a local level, the physical presence of road traffic and its associated pollution appeared to be the largest contributors to outdoor public environmental nuisance. Indoors, the public appeared to experience only minor disturbances from vehicle-derived pollution, with the average respondent being not very bothered by vehicle-derived smoke, fumes and odour, dust and dirt and general air pollution. Noise appeared to cause the greatest indoor traffic-related nuisance, although many respondents complained about soiling from dust/dirt. The surveys suggest that outdoor disturbance from vehicle-derived air pollution was fairly high, with smoke, fumes and odour causing the greatest annoyance. The main reason given for disturbance from outdoor smoke, fumes and odour and dust/dirt was concern that they would harm the public's health. Other important specific reasons included soiling and the smell of the fumes.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)},

With local fitting we can estimate a much wider class of regression surfaces than with the usual classes of parametric functions, such as polynomials. The goal of this article is to show, through applications, how loess can be used for three purposes: data exploration, diagnostic checking of parametric models, and providing a nonparametric regression surface. Along the way, the following methodology is introduced: (a) a multivariate smoothing procedure that is an extension of univariate locally weighted regression; (b) statistical procedures that are analogous to those used in the least-squares fitting of parametric functions; (c) several graphical methods that are useful tools for understanding loess estimates and checking the assumptions on which the estimation procedure is based; and (d) the M plot, an adaptation of Mallows's Cp procedure, which provides a graphical portrayal of the trade-off between variance and bias, and which can be used to choose the amount of smoothing},

abstract = {Four residential communities bisected by Interstate highways were examined to determine the effects of regional accessibility and highway-generated disturbances on property values. Disturbances measured within each community included noise, carbon monoxide, nitrogen dioxide, hydrocarbons, and particulates. Data on traffic mix, volume, and speed were obtained simultaneously. Residents were interviewed to determine their perceptions of highway disturbance and other pertinent information. Data were gathered on all valid property sales from 1969 to 1971 Noise pollution level (NPL) contour lines and CO isopleths were plotted for each community. The NPL regression coefficient was significant in explaining variation in property values in all communities and showed an average loss of 2,050 dollars per property abutting the highway. Based on the high degree of multicollinearity between the NPL and CO variables in the regression model, the NPL coefficient reflects more than just noise-induced property value losses. The relationship among NPL, distance from the highway, and property value loss was determined. There was a high degree of correlation between measured noise (NPL) and perceived noise. Residents objected to noise more than any other highway-originating disturbance. Property value increases due to regional accessibility amounted to 5 million dollars in one community, whereas highway-induced property value losses in the same community were 300,000 dollars. Total highway-induced property value losses in the four study communities amounted to about 2.3 million or an average of 1,120 dollars per property.},

abstract = {The purpose of this paper is to put forth a simplified, aggregative model that will help to explain the sizes and structures of urban areas. The viewpoint taken is that the basic characteristics of cities are to be understood as market responses to opportunities for production and income. Properties of production functions are at the heart of the explanation of city size and structure in the model developed here, in much the way that properties of production functions are at the heart of modern neoclassical growth theory. The general ideas that motivate the selection of the model developed below are commonplace in the voluminous recent literature on urban economics and geography. It has frequently been observed that the large size and rapid recent growth of urban areas are responses to income and employment opportunities provided there as between urban areas of different size. Likewise, it is a common observation on the structure of cities that the nature and intensity of land use vary greatly from city to city and from one part of a city to another.},

abstract = {In Chapter 1, the author describes the approach of his study - an economic one that will focus on how land values are associated with land uses in urban areas, with most of his focus on residential land use. He justifies this by noting that most privately-owned land in urban areas has become residential, specifically four-fifths. He provides a brief history of the study of land values, pre-1900 and post-1900, when urban land values become a bigger focus. Pages 15-17 summarize the main approach and definitions to key terms, including price, size of the site, and the featureless plain. Chapter 2 provides a diagrammatic and mathematical interpretation of individual household equilibrium. It joins the functions for opportunities available to an individual (tied to income) and the combination of preferences (mapped as an indifference surface) for the quantity of land (q), the time taken to travel to the city center (t), and the composite value of all other goods (z), such that dq/dt>0, dq/dz0. Joining these functions shows what combination of goods can be obtained with a given income. Key terms: locus of opportunities, indifference surface. Note that equilibrium, the marginal rate of substitution is equal to the marginal costs. Chapter 3 notes: In the agricultural model, rents are a residual, so they drop with the price of the good. The agricultural model also aims to show how that for determining either the appropriate quantity of land, or the appropriate distance from the city center, marginal revenues should equal marginal costs, i.e. marginal profits should equal 0. Actually, marginal profits equal 0 at two distances; the distance should be where overall revenues exceed the overall costs (represented by the area between the curves) when moving further away. The business model focuses on distance, not quanitity of land. Here the bid rent model is replaced with the bid price model. The bid price function is combined with the price structure. The appropriate distance for locating the firm is where the curves are tangent to each other. Chapter 4 cites an inverse, convex (to the origin) relationship between of price of land and quantity of land if the amount to be paid for land stays constant. Also, the satisfaction (a function of bid price and distance) derived from from buying land at a certain distance from the city changes so that more land is desired to be purchased for less money as distance increases. The marginal rate of substitution equation indicates that distant land will be bought for a cheaper price because commuting costs increase. Commodity prices and profits do not apply to this model as they do to the agriculture and firm models. Chapter 5 focuses on market equilibrium. It notes at the outset that both land and distance are goods, but only land is transacted and has a price. The buyer closest to the city center will have the steepest bid rent curve. Also, the equilibrium price of the buyer immediately further from the center is equal to one's own marginal price, while one's own equilibrium price is the same as the marginal price of the buyer immediately closer to the center. Game theory - decisions based on what others have decided about their acceptable price - is involved in this analysis. Modifications are made to the model so that it allows the supplier to maximize revenue instead of price. Chapter 6 focuses on applications of the model. It is concluded that a rich buyer have a gentler bid price curve, and will be more likely to buy land on the periphery. The chapter also focuses on the effects of income, population growth, trasportation improvements, post-WWII development, and taxation. The effects of land use zoning and density-intensity zoning are also examined. The author then looks at the effect of differences in road accessibility and land areas with more than one urban center.},
